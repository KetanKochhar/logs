# Day 3

Today, there was another MKLO lecture. As usual, it was merged with another class. This time, the lecture was combined with the DBMS lecture.

In the DBMS session, ma'am taught us the following:
- What a database is
- Why we need a database
- Types of databases
- Applications used to manage databases

### Lab Session

During the lab session, we created an account on the Oracle APEX website to use SQL-like commands directly in the browser.

However, due to a high number of account creation requests from the same college IP, Oracle temporarily blocked access. After some time and retries, we were able to log in.

We performed the following tasks:
- Created a table using the command:  
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE <TABLE_NAME> (
    COLUMN_NAME DATATYPE(SIZE),
    COLUMN_NAME DATATYPE(SIZE)
  );
- ```

- Deleted a table using the command:

```sql
DELETE FROM <TABLE_NAME>;
```
