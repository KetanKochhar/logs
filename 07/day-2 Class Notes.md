## **Data Structures (DS)**

### 1. **What is Data?**

- Data is a basic fact or entity used in calculations or manipulations.
- There are two types of data: **numeric** and **alphabetic**.
- When a program collects such types of data for processing, it requires access to the computerâ€™s main memory.
- The process of storing data items in the computer's main memory is called **representation**.
- Data to be processed must be **organized** in a particular structure or format.

### 2. **What is Data Structure?**

- A **data structure** is the representation of the **logical relationship** existing between elements of data.    
- It defines the way of organizing not only the data items but also the **relationships** between them.
- A data structure can be viewed as a **mathematical or logical model** for organizing data items.

### Key Aspects of a Data Structure:

1. **Organization of data**
2. **Accessing methods**
3. **Degree of associativity**
4. **Processing alternatives for information**

The representation of a particular data structure in the memory of a computer is called a_ **structure**.

### **Types of Data Models**:

1. **Entity-Relationship (ER) Model**
2. **Network Data Model**
3. **Relational Data Model**
4. **Object-Oriented Data Model**

### **Entity Types**:

| Type          | Representation   |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| Strong Entity | Rectangle        |
| Weak Entity   | Double Rectangle |

### **Relationship Types**:

| Type                | Representation |
| ------------------- | -------------- |
| Strong Relationship | Diamond        |
| Weak Relationship   | Double Diamond |

### **Attribute Types**:

| Type                  | Representation |
| --------------------- | -------------- |
| Multivalued Attribute | Double Oval    |
| Stored Attribute      | Oval           |
| Derived Attribute     | Dotted Oval    |

An_ **Attribute of a relationship** _is called a_ **Descriptive Attribute**.

### **Mapping Cardinalities**:

1. **One to One (1:1)**
2. **One to Many (1:N)**
3. **Many to One (N:1)**
4. **Many to Many (M:N)**
