# Day 4 

## Data Structures Lecture

- The first lecture was Data Structures.
- Dristi ma'am will teach **linear data structures**.
- Monali ma'am will cover the **introduction to Data Structures**, which will be part of the intermediate exams.

###  Notes: Introduction to Data Structures

#### What is a Data Structure?
A **data structure** is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

#### Types of Data Structures:
- **Linear Data Structures:** Data elements are arranged sequentially.
  - Examples:
    - **Array**: Fixed-size structure to store elements of the same type.
    - **Linked List**: Dynamic structure where elements point to the next one.
    - **Stack**: Follows LIFO (Last In, First Out).
    - **Queue**: Follows FIFO (First In, First Out).
- **Non-Linear Data Structures:** Data is arranged in a hierarchical manner.
  - Examples: Trees, Graphs

#### Advantages of Data Structures:
- Efficient data management
- Reusability
- Helps in algorithm development
- Reduces complexity

### ðŸ“˜ Notes: SQL Operations

#### 1. Create a Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
  id NUMBER,
  name VARCHAR2(50),
  age NUMBER
);
```

#### 2. Insert Data
```sql
INSERT INTO students (id, name, age)
VALUES (1, 'Alice', 20);
```

#### 3. View Table 
```sql
DESC students;
```

#### 3. View table data 
```sql
SELECT * FROM students;
```
