### **EHF Lecture**

**Topic Covered:** Windows Terminal Basics  
Today, we explored the **fundamentals of Windows command-line interface**. The focus was on how to handle file and folder operations directly from the terminal.

### **Data Structures (DS) Lecture**

**Topic Introduced:** Hashing & File Organization  
Chapters 2 and 3 (Linear and Non-Linear Data Structures) will be handled later by the HOD or HOI. For now, **Drishti Maâ€™am** has started with **Chapter 4: Hashing and File Structures**.

####  Notes on File Organization:

**Basic Concepts:**

- **Field:** A single piece of data (e.g., Name, Age)
- **Record:** A group of related fields (e.g., one row of a student database)
- **File:** A collection of related records

---

#### **Types of File Organization:**

1. **Sequential File Organization:**
    - Records are stored in a specific order (usually sorted).
    - Efficient for batch processing, not ideal for frequent access.
2. **Indexed File Organization:**
    - An index is used to quickly access records.
    - Similar to a book index with page numbers.
    - Often used in **index-sequential files**.
3. **Relative (Random) File Organization:**
    - Records are stored at specific locations using a hashing technique.
    - Accessed directly via a key value.
4. **Direct File Organization:**
    - A subset of relative organization with direct access using hash keys.

#### **File Types:**

- **Simple File:** Basic structure, straightforward storage.
- **Clustered File:** Multiple related records stored together to optimize access.
