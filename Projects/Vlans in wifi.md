# VLAN-Based User Segregation in Wi-Fi using ESP32

## üìå Project Title
**Dynamic VLAN Assignment Over Wi-Fi Using ESP32 with LAN8720 Ethernet Bridge**

---

## üìñ Abstract

This project demonstrates a practical approach to network segmentation using Virtual LANs (VLANs) based on user authentication. The system uses an **ESP32** microcontroller in **SoftAP mode** to serve as a captive Wi-Fi access point. After login, users are dynamically assigned to a VLAN by an external server. The ESP32 communicates via Ethernet (LAN8720 module) with a **VLAN-capable router**, enabling real VLAN routing and isolation across the network.

## üéØ Objectives

- Authenticate users on Wi-Fi using a captive portal.
- Assign IP and VLAN dynamically based on user credentials.
- Simulate real enterprise network behavior using open-source and embedded systems.
- Understand and implement basic networking and Layer 2 segmentation using ESP32 and VLAN-capable routers.

## üß∞ Hardware Components

| Component              | Quantity | Description                                  |
|------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| ESP32 Dev Module       | 1        | Runs the Wi-Fi AP and captive portal         |
| LAN8720 Ethernet Module| 1        | Adds Ethernet capability to ESP32            |
| External Server (Laptop/RPi) | 1   | Handles authentication + VLAN mapping logic  |
| VLAN-Capable Router    | 1        | e.g., TP-Link TL-R605, MikroTik hEX, etc.    |
| Breadboard, Wires, PSU | -        | For connectivity and prototyping             |

## üß† Software Stack

- **ESP32 (Arduino / ESP-IDF)**
- **LAN8720 Driver + Ethernet stack**
- **Node.js / Python Flask** (Authentication Server)
- **Router Configuration Interface** (Manual VLAN setup)
- **Wireshark / Nmap** (Optional for testing VLAN traffic)

---

## üîÅ Working Flow

1. **ESP32 (SoftAP Mode)**  
   - Hosts Wi-Fi SSID for users.
   - Captive portal redirects users to login page.

2. **User Login**  
   - Enters username/password via captive portal.
   - ESP32 sends credentials to external server.

3. **External Server Response**  
   - Validates user.
   - Returns assigned VLAN ID and IP range.

4. **ESP32 VLAN Request Forwarding**  
   - Routes user through Ethernet to correct VLAN based on server instruction.
   - VLAN-capable router performs final VLAN assignment.

5. **Network Segregation Achieved**  
   - Each user is isolated in their VLAN.
   - Access control can be applied per VLAN.

## üß™ Example VLAN Mapping

| Username | VLAN ID | Subnet          | Description           |
|----------|---------|------------------|------------------------|
| student1 | VLAN 10 | 192.168.10.0/24 | Internet + Lab Access |
| staff1   | VLAN 20 | 192.168.20.0/24 | Full Access            |
| guest1   | VLAN 30 | 192.168.30.0/24 | Limited Internet Only |

---

## üîí Security & Isolation

- Users in different VLANs cannot ping or access each other.
- Each VLAN can be controlled via router ACLs (Access Control Lists).
- Passwords and IP assignment controlled centrally via secure server logic.
