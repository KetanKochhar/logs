## Basics of Primitive and Non-Primitive Data Types

### Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types are predefined by the programming language. These are the basic building blocks of data manipulation.

**Examples:**  
- int  
- float
- char

---

### Non-Primitive Data Types

Non-primitive data types are created by the programmer or derived from primitive data types. They are used to store complex data and perform more advanced operations.

**Examples:**  
- String  
- Array 
- Function
- Structure
