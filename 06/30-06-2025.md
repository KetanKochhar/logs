# Day 1
Today was the first day of college. We had a one-hour orientation session, which honestly felt pretty boring. The teachers introduced us to the CC (Class Coordinator), SC (Semester Coordinator), and HOD (Head of Department) of the CSE-CS department.

I just barely made it to college on time.

After seeing the schedule — with two DSA labs, one DSA lecture, and one MKLO (Mastering Kali Linux with OSINT) lecture — I wasn’t really in the mood to attend. It looked like a heavy day right from the start.

Luckily, since it was the first day, we had to attend an orientation session for the new CSE department, which took up two hours. Because of that, we missed one of the DSA labs.

Later, we had our first DSA class. It was just an introduction — the teacher explained what topics we’ll be covering and gave us an overview of the syllabus.

The MKLO lecture was merged with **IDT (Innovation and Design Thinking - I)**. The teacher explained that we’ll have to form a group, choose a project topic, and work on it throughout the semester. We’re required to maintain a **logbook**, create an **AEIOU canvas**, and build a **working prototype** based on our project idea.

After that, we attended the final DSA lab session of the day. Monali ma'am gave us a task to research the **advantages and disadvantages of pointers**. In the second half of the lab, we performed a practical exercise on **pointer functions** — specifically, **call by value** and **call by reference** in the C programming language.
